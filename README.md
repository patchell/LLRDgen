	The parse table looks like it is being
	generated correctly.  It at least works with
	the simple example that is always used in
	compiler books (In my case, The Dragon Book 2nd edition).
	Next up, generate code.
	By the way, that part is going to be very
	minimal.

	Something got goofed up.  This time with the project file.  So once 
again, I start over.  Well, not completely.
Created a new project and copied in the files.  Still, I hate it when 
this happens.

I think I have Follow sets working.  One Issue with
left for test2.gram, 'Assignment' shows up with no
follow set.  You CS students might actually get a C+
when you turn this in as your homework.

Note: For an example grammar with a known follow
set, I get an exact match :)

I do believe that Creating a first set is now complete.
You CS students might actually get a C on this.

Still working on creating the First Sets.
There is still one rabit hole to go down yet,
but currently, All the first sets do look correct,
but there is still one last test for first sets that need
to be written.  I would have never guessed just how difficult
this is.
And if you want to turn this project in as your CS home work,
well, you might actually be able to get a C-, but only
if you clean up all the superfulous garbage.

Much Better.  Next Up:First and Follow Sets

I think I am generating the First Sets correctly.
Next up: Follow Sets.  This is going to be
much more difficult.
